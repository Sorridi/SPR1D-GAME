The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.
The degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is determined more by the economic and technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of government.
A technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often turns out to threaten it very seriously later on.
Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them drugs to take away their unhappiness.
Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual's internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.
The concept of mental health in our society is defined largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress.
Our society tends to regard as a 'sickness' any mode of thought or behavior that is inconvenient for the system, and this is plausible because when an individual doesn't fit into the system it causes pain to the individual as well as problems for the system.
